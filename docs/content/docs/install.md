# Install The App

Currently there is only a developer release, so you will have to install it
"manually" from the manifest file. (Said another way, it is not in the excel
app store).

- Download the latest app manifest file.

1. Go here https://github.com/bmayfi3ld/excel-scheduler/blob/main/addin/manifest.xml
2. Click the little download button. `Download raw file`

- Install that manifest into your excel

1. Open your workbook
2. Click on `Add-ins`
